## Vision Statement
Our Vision for MedCom is to create an ecosystem where medical data could be easily shared
among different entities without the concern for privacy and security. For the doctors who need
the information about the medical background and record of a patient, the MedCom is an
ecosystem with Web and Mobile based applications that will help the doctors to store and
maintain the patientâ€™s record on a safe and secure ledger. Unlike the existing standard EHR
systems developed for legacy systems for which the sharing of data is near to impossible, the
MedCom a Blockchain based EHR system provides the facility of sharing of data and
interoperability among different HealthCare organizations over a confidential and secure
platform.
